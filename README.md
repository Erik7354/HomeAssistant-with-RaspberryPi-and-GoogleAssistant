# HomeAssistant-with-RaspberryPi-and-GoogleAssistant
This Repo is basically about the Google Assistant running on my Raspberry Pi 3B, controlling NeoPixel and hopefully doing more things in the future.


-> you can find the code for the Rpi3 and the NodeMCU in the "source" folder
-> PixelArt contains some example images with a 8x8 resolution for testing
-> "colArrows" is a collection of images which are destined to be used for an animation, the json contains informations for that


abridged goals/journey:
- installing/running the Google Assistant on the Rpi3 ✅
- running Google Assistant and controlling the NeoPixel simultaneously on the Rpi ❌
- controlling the NeoPixel with the NodeMCU ✅
- transferring data between the Rpi and the NodeMCU over html ✅ 
- building a case and installing all components ⬜
- testing full functionality ⬜

physical components:
- Raspberry Pi 3B
- NodeMCU Lolin V3
- 8x8 WS2812 matrix from AZ-Delivery
